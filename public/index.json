Each player has their own playstyle, whether it involves sneaking up on enemies or engaging in instant combat. Additionally, some players may have brief interactions with certain characters, while others may spend more time delving into their AI intricacies. From the perspective of AI programmers and designers, they meticulously craft every detail of the characters and their environments. However, for players, these elements only come to life when they encounter them. A diligently planned routine for an enemy\u0026rsquo;s response to player engagement becomes irrelevant if the enemy is defeated with a headshot moments later.\nThe Player Only Knows so Much #\rWhile certain aspects like emotional states can be effectively conveyed through animations and sounds (e.g., a character crying), players often have limited time to grasp the full context surrounding NPCs. Although a subset of curious players might choose to observe their adversaries before engaging, many others will have fleeting encounters. Therefore, it becomes crucial to align a character\u0026rsquo;s AI with its purpose in the game and the attention it is likely to receive from players. Excessively adding AI complexity to incidental characters might impress a small portion of the audience, but the majority would perceive it as poor programming.\nIn AI for Games, Ian Millington provides the following example:\nA guard standing in a dark room hears a noise: \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;d flick the light switch,\u0026rsquo; we think. If the guard doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that, we might assume they are stupid. [\u0026hellip;] If we see a guard who has heard a noise suddenly turn away and move slowly in the opposite direction, we assume the AI is faulty. The guard should have moved across the room toward the noise. If we observed them for longer and saw the guard head over to a light switch by the exit, their action would be understandable. Then again, the guard might not flick on the light switch after all, and we might take that as a sign of poor implementation. However, the guard may know that the light is inoperable, or they may have been waiting for a colleague to slip some cigarettes under the door and thought the noise was a predefined signal. If we knew all that, we\u0026rsquo;d know the action was intelligent after all.\nMake Changes in Behavior Clear #\rMillington also makes a notable observation: behavioral changes in characters stand out more than the behaviors themselves. When a character fails to exhibit an expected change in behavior, it immediately draws attention and disrupts immersion. Such a scenario can have a detrimental effect on the overall gaming experience, leaving players feeling disconnected and dissatisfied. To avoid this, meticulous attention must be given to ensuring that characters\u0026rsquo; AI responds appropriately to contextual triggers and events, enhancing the sense of realism and maintaining immersion throughout the game.\nBy understanding the diverse ways players approach and interact with characters, designers can make informed decisions about AI behavior, emphasizing the need to create characters that not only feel alive and believable but also adapt convincingly to dynamic gameplay scenarios.\nReferences #\rMillington, I.

However, the truth is that the only thing that needs to be smart is the programmer behind it.\nThe primary objective of video game AI is not to replicate every nuance of complex human behavior, but rather to create interactions that engage and immerse the player in the game world. In the real world, we understand that people act based on their own interests and motivations, shaped by their unique experiences. If we were to shout at someone in the street and they didn\u0026rsquo;t react, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t jump to the conclusion that they lack intelligence, we would take their lack of a response as acceptable. However, when it comes to AI in video games, our expectations shift. If we shout at an NPC standing in a virtual street and they remain unresponsive, we interpret their lack of reaction as a sign of unintelligence or stupidity.\nThey Need Responsive AI #\rThis distinction arises because video games are interactive media. They surpass the passive consumption of stories or simulations and invite players to actively participate and shape the game world and its inhabitants. Players inherently anticipate having an impact on the characters and the environment, as well as receiving meaningful feedback in return for their actions.\nThe crucial aspect lies in ensuring that the characters respond appropriately to the player\u0026rsquo;s actions, creating a sense of dynamic and believable interaction. When a player initiates an attack on an NPC, the NPC should exhibit self-defense behaviors, fighting back or attempting to flee. Conversely, when the player extends help or assistance to an NPC, expressions of gratitude or rewards should be present to reinforce positive interactions.\nAnd They Want Fun AI #\rThe paramount focus should lie in the ability to engender emergent gameplay that captivates and entertains players, rather than solely seeking to impress them with the intricacies of a complex system. While technical complexity can certainly be awe-inspiring, it is the generation of enjoyable and unpredictable experiences that truly enhances the player\u0026rsquo;s engagement and satisfaction. By prioritizing the creation of AI systems that facilitate dynamic interactions, unexpected outcomes, and moments of surprise, game developers can provide players with immersive and memorable gaming experiences that emphasize the sheer joy of playing.\nFocus on What Really Matters #\rThough there have been times where developers have implemented a large degree of complexity to their AI characters and have succeeded in making the game more fun and immersive, in most cases it is best to keep them as simple as possible.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want your players thinking that the AI you created is dumb, then stop trying to replicate human intelligence and focus in crafting characters that react the way the player wants them to. And if you want your AI to be praised, then look out for ways to improve its ability to foster fun and emergent gameplay that keeps players coming back for more. You\u0026rsquo;ll find that, more often than not, simple design choices end up being more important than technical Intricacies.\n","date":"14 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/its-not-about-complexity-its-about-interaction/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Players Don\u0026rsquo;t Want Intelligent AI #\rThe misconception surrounding AI in video games often stems from the assumption that game characters must possess high levels of intelligence to be considered impressive.","title":"It's Not About Complexity, It's About Interaction","type":"blog"},{"content":"Some of the posts on this website are written with the help of OpenAI tools.

A symbolic system consists of two components: a set of knowledge, which can be words, numbers, sentences, pictures, or any other kind of information, and a reasoning algorithm to generate problem solutions or new knowledge.\nSearch and knowledge are intrinsically linked in AI. The more knowledge you have, the less searching you need to do for an answer you need. Conversely, the more search you can do, the less knowledge you need. This trade-off between knowledge and search is unavoidable in any AI system. Symbolic systems acknowledge this and give their algorithms a large amount of knowledge to process. They have been widely applicable to games, as they can model various aspects of game logic, such as blackboard architectures, pathfinding, decision trees, state machines, and more.\nThe Rise of Deep Learning #\rIn recent years, there was a tendency to assume that symbolic approaches were dead, and that deep learning was the future of AI. Deep learning is a form of statistical computing that uses neural networks to learn from data and perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. Deep learning is essentially a compute intensive search technique: it tries to find patterns in data by adjusting the weights of the network connections.\nOne of the most impressive examples of deep learning is AlphaGo Zero, a program that learned to play the game of Go from scratch, without any human guidance or prior knowledge. AlphaGo Zero had minimal knowledge of the rules of the game, but extraordinary amounts of processing time and resources: it played millions of games against itself to improve its skills.\nSimplicity Drives Control #\rHowever, this does not mean that symbolic AI is obsolete or irrelevant. In fact, for most game applications, symbolic AI is still preferable and superior to deep learning. For example, a character that needs to use a health pack when injured can be told that explicitly using a simple rule:\nIF injured THEN use health pack This rule requires no search at all: it directly tells the character what to do in a given situation. It is also easy to understand, modify, and debug by developers. On the other hand, if we wanted to use deep learning to achieve the same behavior, we would need to train a neural network with a lot of data and feedback, which would take a lot of time and resources. And even then, we would not have much control or insight into how the network makes its decisions.\nSymbolic AI Prevails #\rThe only way any algorithm can outperform another is to consume more processing power or to be optimized toward a specific set of problems. However, games are usually designed to run on consumer hardware, which means that graphics and sound take up the majority of the processing power. For AI, this means that game developers have to be smart and efficient with their algorithms. In many cases, low computation / high knowledge approaches are often the clear winners.\nThis is not to say that statistical computing techniques are not useful for games. They can be very useful for specific problems that require complex pattern recognition or adaptation. However, for games they are often unnecessary: the same effect can often be achieved better, faster, and with more control using a simpler approach.\nIn conclusion, AI used in games is still largely based on symbolic technology. Symbolic AI offers many benefits for game development: it is expressive, efficient, transparent, and flexible. Symbolic AI is not dead: it is alive and kicking in games.\nReferences #\rMillington, I.
