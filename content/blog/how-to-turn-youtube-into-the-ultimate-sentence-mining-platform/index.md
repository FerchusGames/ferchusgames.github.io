## The Case for Sentence Mining on YouTube

### Why YouTube?



### Should I Sentence Mine on YouTube?

## Setting Up for Success

### Designate a Specific Account for Each Language

You don't want to mix the YouTube account that you use for regular entertainment with the one you'll use for sentence mining; it just makes it harder to fully commit to one or the other. Because of that, as a first step, I recommend that you assign or create a YouTube account for the sole purpose of consuming content on your target language. It's okay if you've already watched other type of videos on that account as the important thing is that you only have subscriptions to channels in the language you're studying. 

### Find Content You Care About

### Make Your Computer "Study Only"

After following these steps I also recommend taking the opportunity to clear YouTube as a source of distraction in your computer and using it for regular entertainment only in the living room TV or somewhere else to make a strong mental connection between using the site on a pc and studying a language. 

It's obviously okay to also use you computer for other types of studies, just make sure that it's straight-up academic content and not edutainment (which should be relatively easy, given all the ways we've transformed the platform here). Sure, you learn a thing or two with them, but it still is a leisure activity, so leave it for your entertainment device of choice.

## Essential Tools to Enhance Your Experience

### Unhook: Eliminate Distractions

When browsing through YouTube, a lot of people get the feeling that they are just wasting their time watching videos that they aren't even interested in. It is normal to feel bad about this and start blaming your lack of discipline or self control, but you don't really notice all of the things that the site bombards you with to keep you in until you get rid of them. You'll be surprised how different the YouTube experience is without all of those intrusive distractions, with only your carefully selected subscriptions and the search bar to find videos that you actually want to watch.

{{< button href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid" target="_blank" >}}
Install Unhook
{{< /button >}}

Clicking on the extension icon will show you the pop-up menu. If it appears like this, you need to turn it on by clicking on the big gray button:

![Unhook Off](/images/youtube-guide/unhook-off.png)

These are my recommended settings, but you can adjust it to your liking:

Enabling	 the settings marked with __red rectangles__ is __not recommended__ and interferes with the next extension's functionality.

### PocketTube: Better Video Browsing

This is actually a set of two extensions that go hand in hand. These are the most feature-packed addons of the list and are the ones that inspired me to create it. Because of how much stuff they bring to elevate the experience, I made this video to show how you can use them to make finding videos for sentence mining way easier:

{{< youtubeLite id="ZT_5Q6l8F0s" label="How to use PocketTube for sentence mining" >}}

There is an official YouTube channel for the extensions, but I find their videos to be a bit all over the place. Still, if you are still interested in learning more about them (specially if you become a Patreon), I do recommend [checking it out](https://www.youtube.com/@PocketTubeHQ/videos).

Now that you know what they do and how they work, you can go and install them both:

{{< button href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pockettube-youtube-subscr/kdmnjgijlmjgmimahnillepgcgeemffb" target="_blank" >}}
Install PocketTube Subscriptions Manager
{{< /button >}}
‎

{{< button href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pockettube-youtube-playli/bplnofkhjdphoihfkfcddikgmecfehdd?hl=en" target="_blank" >}}
Install PocketTube Playlist Manager
{{< /button >}}

I should mention that it is a freemium extension and the version that you saw in the video is the paid one. The free version limits the Deck to only one group column, one channel column, and doesn't allow for playlist columns. It also doesn't have the custom duration filter on playlists, but it does allow you to filter by predetermined ones (0-15, 15-60, 60+ minutes). 

It's not necessary at all to purchase the premium membership, as __the free version is already amazing__, but if you are absolutely serious about using YouTube as your main mining source, I absolutely recommend it. It is only __3$ USD a month__ and there are many benefits that you can explore in the Patreon tab both on the Deck/Group feed and the PocketTube button in the _You_ section on the left (each one displaying benefits for their respective extension). The main ones for me being:

- Full access to Deck
- Unlimited 'mark as watched' for videos (With an eye icon on the right of every thumbnail)
- Custom filter by duration in the playlist
- Batch selection for Save to Playlist (Useful to create a "playlist of playlists")
- Batch selection for 'mark as watched'

You can join the Patreon by going on [this link](https://www.patreon.com/c/ysub) and subscribing and you can activate it on the same Patreon tab where you can browse the benefits. I am in no way affiliated with PocketTube or its creators, I'm just a very happy customer that wants to share it with others.

{{< alert >}}
You can move the _Subscription groups_ section up or down with the arrows below them, but you should keep it either at the top or below the _Deck_ button for _Unhook_ to work correctly. __If you move it down too much, the whole section will dissapear.__ Do not panic, just turn off _Unhook_, bring it back to the top and turn it on again.

#### No Playlist Autoplay for YouTube

PocketTube makes it easy to create playlists of unwatched videos, but there's a catch: it marks a video as "Watched" if it has been played, even for a second. Since YouTube auto-plays the next video in a playlist by default, with no official way of disabling it, which can lead to videos being marked as watched unintentionally. To prevent this, install this extension, which stops auto-play at the end of a video. You can manually play the next video by clicking on it, pressing the _NEXT_ button, or using the _(SHIFT + N)_ shortcut.

### uBlockOrigin: Ads and Extra Elements Blocking

Almost everyone knows that adblockers block, well... ads, but not a lot of people know that some of them can also block specific elements in a page. The one that I prefer is uBlockOrigin; it has that function and we're going to eliminate distracting clutter. 

{{< button href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en" target="_blank" >}}
Install uBlock Origin
{{< /button >}}

Once you've installed it, click on the extension and then the gear icon in the menu:

![uBlockOrigin Interface](/images/youtube-guide/adblock-popup.png)

The next page will open:

![uBlockOrigin Filter](/images/youtube-guide/adblock-filter.png)

Now copy and paste this element list to it and click _Apply Changes_.


```html
www.youtube.com###logo
www.youtube.com##ytd-guide-entry-renderer.ytd-guide-section-renderer.style-scope:nth-of-type(1)
www.youtube.com##ytd-guide-entry-renderer.ytd-guide-collapsible-section-entry-renderer.style-scope:nth-of-type(2)
www.youtube.com##ytd-guide-entry-renderer.ytd-guide-collapsible-section-entry-renderer.style-scope:nth-of-type(3)
```

The differences are minimal, but you can notice them in the left sidebar and the page logo; now it only has the buttons you need. If you find another element that you want to block, you can use the __eyedropper tool__ to the left of the gear icon in the menu to pick one. If you mess up, you can always go back to the element list and delete the one you just added to the list.

### Redirect: Start Your Mining Day on the Right Foot
	
This extension, as the name imples, redirects you to another link when you enter a website. We'll use this to optimize YouTube's default page for mining with interesting videos at your level.

{{< button href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirect/lfoabmjnfpgnafoagflchdgblfhnfccg" target="_blank" >}}
Install Redirect
{{< /button >}}

After installing it and clicking on the extension icon, this interface will pop up.

![Redirect Interface](/images/youtube-guide/redirect.png)

In _From URL_, paste this:

```html
https://www.youtube.com
```

In _To URL_, since the deck that comes with PocketTube's free tier is rather limiting, I recommend to input something different depending on if you're subscribed to the Patreon or not:

- You're a Patreon member:

  ```html
  https://www.youtube.com/#ysm-deck
  ```

- You're on the free version (You can only choose one of the following):

  - The subscription feed:
    ```html
    https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions
    ```
  - Your favorite subscription group you've made. If it is "Vlog", for example, it would be:
    ```html
    https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions#ysm-group-title=Vlog
    ```
  - A playlist you enjoy all or most of the videos in it. You can change the playlist once you've finished it. For example: 
    ```html
    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUqu4MKiV5q_msliiqZJSEscdPuwUAWG2
    ```

Now, whenever you go to the YouTube home page you'll be greeted with only videos you want to see.

## Optimizing Your Workflow

### Always Use Fullscreen

You can enter and exit fullscreen by pressing __F11__ in any browser. If you tend to wander around in your browser or other apps when you should be concentrating on the current video, this is a must. Very simple tip, but extremely effective.
